4. **Sentence length: 25-35 words** (one breath)
5. **Reads naturally** (no keyword stuffing)

### ‚ùå Fail Criteria:

- No specific metrics

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Criteria:

## üéØ Expected Results

### Before Rewrite:
- **67% fail rate** on first-sentence intent

- **High bounce rate** (user has to scroll to understand)

### After Rewrite (Target):
- **100% pass rate** on first-sentence intent
- **2-3 seconds** to comprehend value prop
- **20-30% lower bounce rate**
- **Higher SERP CTR** (keyword + outcome in first sentence)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Script not running?
- **Check console for errors:** The script auto-loads in dev mode
- **Verify file import:** Check `src/main.tsx` imports `validateIntentRewrites.ts`
- **Hard refresh:** Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

### Getting validation failures?
- **Check keyword placement:** Must be in first 15 words
- **Add pain language:** Include words like "waste", "lose", "cost", "struggle"
- **Add metrics:** Include specific numbers (%, hours, $, clients)

### Script runs but shows 0 pages?
- **Check data imports:** Verify `cmsPages.ts` exports are correct
- **Check page files:** Ensure solution/industry page files exist
- **Check keyword mappings:** Verify `serviceKeywords` and `solutionKeywords` objects

## üìà Post-Deployment Monitoring

After deploying, monitor these metrics:

1. **Bounce Rate** (Google Analytics)
   - Target: 20-30% reduction
   - Check: Compare 30 days pre/post deployment

2. **Time on Page** (Google Analytics)
   - Target: Increased engagement on hero section
   - Check: Scroll depth and time above fold

3. **SERP CTR** (Google Search Console)
   - Target: Higher click-through rate from search
   - Check: Impressions vs clicks for target keywords

4. **Conversion Rate** (Forms/Calls)
   - Target: 10-20% increase in consultation bookings
   - Check: Form submissions and phone call volume

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Run validation script** (see above)
2. **Fix any failures** (keyword placement, metrics, pain language)
3. **Deploy to production**
4. **Monitor metrics** (bounce rate, CTR, conversions)
5. **A/B test variations** (if needed)
