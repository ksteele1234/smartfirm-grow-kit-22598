Client communication automation handles the status updates, appointment reminders, follow up sequences, and bulk communications that keep your clients informed and your team focused on the work.",

    {
      "question": "Will our clients know these messages are automated?",
      "answer": "Not if we do our job well, and we take this seriously. Every template is written to sound like it came from a real person at your firm, using your voice and your tone. The timing is designed to feel natural rather than robotic. Most clients simply experience better, more consistent communication from your firm, and they appreciate it without ever thinking about what is happening behind the scenes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we control which messages go out and when?",
      "answer": "You have full control over every aspect of the communication. We configure the triggers, timing, and content together during setup, and you approve everything before it goes live. If your preferences change or you want to adjust the messaging for a specific client segment, we can update the templates and rules at any time. Nothing goes out that you have not reviewed and approved."
    },
    {
      "question": "What communication channels can we automate?",
      "answer": "We typically set up automation across email and SMS since those cover the vast majority of client communication needs. Some firms also use platforms like GoHighLevel for centralized messaging that includes chat and social channels. We configure whatever combination makes sense for how your clients prefer to be reached."
