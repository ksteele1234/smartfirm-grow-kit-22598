      "question": "Which CRM platform do you recommend for accounting firms?",
      "answer": "It depends on your firm's size, budget, and what you need the CRM to do. We frequently work with GoHighLevel because it combines CRM, email, and automation in one platform, which tends to work well for {audience} who want to keep things consolidated. But we can also configure other platforms if you already have a preference or an existing system you want to optimize."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we already have a CRM but nobody is using it?",
      "answer": "That is actually one of the most common situations we walk into. Usually the problem is that the CRM was set up generically and does not match how your team actually works. We audit your current setup, clean up the data, reconfigure it to fit your workflows, and retrain your team. Most firms see a significant improvement in adoption once the system feels like it was built for them."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does CRM setup typically take?",
      "answer": "For most firms, we can have a fully configured CRM live within two to four weeks. That includes discovery, data migration, pipeline setup, integrations, and team training. More complex setups with multiple service lines or extensive data migration may take a bit longer, but we scope that out clearly during our initial conversation."
