      "question": "What tools do you typically use for data automation?",
      "answer": "Dext is one of the primary tools we implement for receipt and document processing. Depending on your firm's tech stack, we may also configure automation within your accounting platform itself or connect additional tools that handle bank feeds and categorization. During discovery we look at what you are already using and recommend the best fit."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is automated data capture compared to manual entry?",
      "answer": "In most cases, automated capture is more accurate than manual entry because it eliminates typos and fatigue related errors. That said, no system is perfect. We configure review workflows so your team can quickly verify anything the system flags as uncertain, which keeps accuracy high without creating a new bottleneck."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will our clients need to change how they send us receipts and documents?",
      "answer": "The transition is usually quite simple for clients. In many cases they just need to take a photo with their phone or forward an email. Some clients actually prefer it because it is faster than their old process. We help you communicate the change so clients understand the benefit and feel comfortable with the new workflow."
