  "heroDescription": "For most {audience}, leads come in through the website, phone, or referral and then sit in someone's inbox until they have time to respond. By then, the prospect has often moved on to a competitor who replied faster. Lead automation solves this by capturing every inquiry instantly, responding within minutes regardless of your team's availability, routing leads to the right person, and following up systematically until the prospect either books a meeting or tells you they are not interested. The firms that convert the most leads are not necessarily better at what they do. They are just better at responding quickly and following up consistently.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can this work with leads from different sources?",
      "answer": "Yes. We design the system to capture leads from wherever they come in, including your website, Google Business Profile, social media, referral partners, and even phone calls. During discovery, we map out all of your lead sources and create a unified system so nothing gets missed regardless of how the prospect finds you.",
      "category": "Implementation"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you prevent automated follow ups from annoying prospects?",
      "answer": "Timing and relevance are everything. We design sequences with appropriate spacing between messages, provide genuinely useful information in each touchpoint, and include easy opt out options. The sequences also stop automatically when a prospect takes action like booking a meeting. The goal is to be helpfully persistent, not annoying.",
      "category": "General"
    },
    {
      "question": "What tools do you use for lead automation?",
      "answer": "We typically build lead automation systems using GoHighLevel, which provides CRM, email, SMS, and pipeline management in a single platform. However, we are tool agnostic and can integrate with your existing systems if you already have a CRM or email platform you prefer. We assess your current setup during discovery and recommend the approach that works best for your situation.",

  "audienceOverrides": {
    "bookkeepers": {
      "heroDescription": "When a small business owner reaches out about bookkeeping services, they are often contacting two or three firms at the same time. The bookkeeper who responds first and follows up most consistently typically wins the client. But when you are in the middle of month end closes or reconciling accounts, responding to new inquiries quickly is nearly impossible. Lead automation solves this by capturing every inquiry instantly, sending a professional response within minutes, and following up systematically until the prospect books a meeting or tells you they went with someone else. You get more clients from the same number of leads without adding to your workload."
    },
    "tax preparers": {
      "heroDescription": "Tax preparers face a unique lead management challenge. Inquiries peak right when your capacity to respond is at its lowest. During filing season, prospective clients who contact your firm may wait days for a callback, and by then they have already hired someone else. Lead automation ensures every inquiry gets an instant professional response regardless of how busy your team is, with follow up sequences that nurture prospects who are not ready to commit immediately. For the off season, automated systems keep your advisory and planning services in front of leads who expressed interest months ago but were not ready to move forward."
