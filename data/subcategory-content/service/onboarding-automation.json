    {
      "question": "What if we onboard different types of clients who need different things?",
      "answer": "That is the norm for most {audience}, and the automation is designed to handle it. We build separate onboarding paths for each service type so a new tax client gets a different sequence and document list than a new bookkeeping client. The system routes each client to the right workflow based on the services they signed up for."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will clients feel like they are being processed through a machine?",
      "answer": "The opposite, actually. When onboarding is automated well, clients experience a smoother, more organized process than they would with manual emails and phone calls. The messaging is written in your firm's voice, and the automation handles logistics so your team has more time for the personal touches that actually build relationships."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does this work with our existing practice management system?",
      "answer": "We design the onboarding automation to complement whatever tools you are already using. If you are on Karbon, for example, we can configure task triggers and client status updates that sync with your existing workflow. During discovery, we map out your current systems and identify the best integration points so everything works together instead of creating more fragmentation."

    "tax preparers": {
      "heroDescription": "For tax preparers, onboarding often means clients showing up without the documents you need, unclear about your timeline, and confused about what is included in their engagement. When you are trying to onboard dozens of clients during intake season, those inefficiencies multiply quickly. We build automated onboarding systems that send clear instructions, collect documents systematically, and deliver engagement terms before the first appointment so every client arrives prepared."
