      "question": "What payment methods can clients use through the portal?",
      "answer": "Most payment portals support credit cards, debit cards, and ACH bank transfers. We configure the options based on what works best for your firm, including any preferences you have around processing fees. Some firms pass card fees through to clients while absorbing ACH costs, for example."

      "question": "Can we automate billing for clients on different pricing structures?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Whether you bill hourly, on a fixed fee retainer, per return, or with a combination of pricing models, we can configure the automation to handle each client's billing terms individually. The system sends the right invoice at the right time regardless of how each engagement is structured."

    {
      "question": "How do automated payment reminders avoid annoying our clients?",
      "answer": "We help you design reminder sequences that feel professional and helpful rather than aggressive. The messaging, timing, and tone are all customizable. And reminders stop automatically once a payment is received, so clients never get a follow up for something they already paid."
