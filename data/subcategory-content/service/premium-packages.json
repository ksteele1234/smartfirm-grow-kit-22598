      "question": "What makes a premium package different from your standard services?",
      "answer": "Three things primarily: dedicated resources, deeper customization, and priority timelines. Standard implementations follow proven templates and processes that work well for most firms. Premium packages start from a blank canvas, with a dedicated team building something tailored specifically to your firm. You also get faster implementation timelines and ongoing priority support."

    {
      "question": "Is a premium package worth it for a smaller firm?",
      "answer": "It depends on your goals and complexity rather than your size alone. Some smaller firms have sophisticated service offerings, high value clients, or ambitious growth plans that benefit significantly from the deeper customization and dedicated attention that a premium package provides. We are happy to discuss whether it makes sense for your specific situation during a discovery call."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does ongoing support look like after the initial build?",
      "answer": "Your dedicated team stays with your firm after launch. That includes priority access for questions and issues, regular strategy reviews to make sure your automation evolves with your firm, and proactive monitoring that catches potential problems before they affect your operations. Think of it as having a technology partner on retainer who knows your systems inside and out."
