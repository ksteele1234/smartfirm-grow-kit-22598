  "heroDescription": "Online reviews are one of the most powerful trust signals for {audience}, yet most firms leave review generation entirely to chance. Review automation takes the guesswork out of this process by systematically requesting feedback at the right moments, through the right channels, and following up when clients do not respond the first time. The difference between firms with 15 reviews and firms with 150 reviews is rarely about client satisfaction. It is about having a system that asks consistently and makes it easy for clients to follow through.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Which review platforms should we focus on?",
      "answer": "For most {audience}, Google Business Profile is the highest priority because it directly influences local search visibility. Beyond that, it depends on your market and where your prospective clients are researching. We assess your specific situation during discovery and recommend a platform strategy that makes sense for your practice.",

    {
      "question": "What if we get a negative review?",
      "answer": "Negative reviews happen to every firm eventually. What matters is how you respond. We set up monitoring so you catch negative reviews quickly, and we provide response frameworks that demonstrate professionalism. A thoughtful response to a negative review can actually build more trust than no negative reviews at all, because prospective clients see how you handle difficult situations.",
      "category": "General"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will clients feel pressured by automated review requests?",
      "answer": "Not when the system is designed thoughtfully. Requests are timed for moments when client satisfaction is naturally high, written in a friendly and non pushy tone, and easy to ignore if a client prefers not to participate. Most clients are happy to leave a review when the process is convenient. They just need to be asked.",

    "bookkeepers": {
      "heroDescription": "For bookkeepers, online reviews are especially important because prospective small business clients often research several options before choosing who to trust with their finances. Yet most bookkeeping practices have a handful of reviews at best, not because clients are unhappy, but because no one has a system to ask consistently. Review automation changes this by sending requests at the right time through channels clients actually use, and following up automatically when they do not respond right away. The result is a steady stream of authentic reviews that helps your practice stand out in your local market."
    },
    "tax preparers": {
      "heroDescription": "Tax preparers have a unique advantage when it comes to reviews. Clients are often relieved and grateful right after their returns are filed, which is the perfect moment to request feedback. But during busy season, asking for reviews is the last thing on your mind. Review automation captures that window of client satisfaction automatically, sending requests at the optimal moment and following up without anyone on your team lifting a finger. By the time next season rolls around, you could have significantly more reviews working for you than you do today."
