The firms winning at local search are not necessarily doing anything flashy.

    "tax preparers": {
      "heroDescription": "For tax preparers, search demand follows a predictable cycle. Searches spike dramatically in the months before filing deadlines and taper off during the rest of the year. The firms that capture the most clients during peak season are the ones who invested in their search visibility months earlier. SEO for tax preparers includes optimizing your Google Business Profile for local visibility, targeting the specific keywords prospective clients use when searching for tax help, and building a content strategy that positions your firm as a trusted resource year round. We also help with off season visibility for advisory and planning services, so your practice is not entirely dependent on seasonal demand."
