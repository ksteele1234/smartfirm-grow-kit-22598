    {
      "question": "What if our firm offers multiple service lines?",
      "answer": "That is very common, and it is actually one of the reasons a service type approach works so well. We assess each service line independently and help you decide which one to automate first. Most firms start with their highest volume service and expand from there as they see results."

    {
      "question": "Do you work with firms that are transitioning from compliance to advisory?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Many of the firms we work with are making that shift, and automation plays a significant role in freeing up the time needed to offer higher value advisory services. We can help you build systems that support both your existing compliance work and the advisory practice you are growing into."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle seasonal fluctuations like tax season?",
      "answer": "We design workflows that account for your busy periods. For tax focused firms, that typically means building automation that ramps up document collection and client communication ahead of deadlines, then shifts to follow up and extension management as the season progresses. The system adapts to your calendar, not the other way around."
