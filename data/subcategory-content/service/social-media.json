      "question": "Do we need to approve every post before it goes live?",
      "answer": "That is entirely up to you. Some firms prefer to review and approve content before publication, and we are happy to build that into the workflow. Others trust us to post on their behalf after the initial discovery phase where we learn your voice and preferences. We can start with an approval process and transition to a more hands off arrangement as you get comfortable."

    {
      "question": "Will social media actually bring us new clients?",
      "answer": "We are honest about this: social media for {audience} is typically more about building credibility and staying visible than generating direct leads. When a prospect searches for you or a referral source considers recommending you, your social presence reinforces that you are active, knowledgeable, and professional. That supporting role can make a significant difference in how your other marketing efforts convert."

    "tax preparers": {
      "heroDescription": "Most tax preparers have social media accounts that go dark after April and only come alive again when filing season approaches. That feast or famine pattern hurts your visibility and makes it harder to promote advisory services during the off season. We manage your social media year round, creating and scheduling content that keeps your firm visible to prospects and referral partners whether it is January or July."
