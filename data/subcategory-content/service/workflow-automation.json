      "question": "What practice management tools do you work with?",
      "answer": "We are experienced with a range of practice management platforms and configure workflows based on what your firm uses or plans to adopt. Karbon is one we work with frequently because of its strong workflow automation capabilities, but we can also work with other platforms depending on your situation. During discovery, we assess what you have in place and recommend the best path forward."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you learn our processes well enough to automate them?",
      "answer": "That is what the discovery phase is for. We sit down with you and your team to map out how work actually moves through your firm today, including the informal steps and workarounds that never made it into a written process. From there, we design workflows that capture what works well and improve what does not. You are involved throughout, so nothing gets automated in a way that does not reflect how your firm operates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if our processes are messy and not well defined yet?",
      "answer": "That is more common than you might think, and it is actually a great time to bring in workflow automation. Part of what we do during discovery is help you identify and define the processes that should be standardized. We do not just automate chaos. We help you design cleaner processes first, then build the automation around them."

We build workflow automation systems that assign tasks, track progress, and escalate approaching deadlines so every return moves through your process reliably and your team can focus on the work itself."
