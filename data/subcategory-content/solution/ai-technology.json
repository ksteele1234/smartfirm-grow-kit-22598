  "solutionOverview": "AI is genuinely useful for accounting firms today, but only when applied to the right problems. The biggest wins are not in replacing your team. They are in eliminating the tedious data handling, document processing, and routine communication that slow everything else down.",

  "faqs": [
    { "question": "Is AI going to replace accountants?", "answer": "No, and that framing misses the point entirely. AI is very good at handling repetitive, data heavy tasks like document reading and categorization. It is not good at professional judgment, client relationships, or strategic advice. The firms using AI well are freeing their people to do more of the high value work, not less." },
    { "question": "We tried an AI tool before and nobody used it. What makes this different?", "answer": "Most failed AI adoptions happen because the tool was chosen before the problem was clearly defined. We start with your specific workflows and bottlenecks, then select tools that directly address those issues. When the tool clearly saves someone time on a task they dislike, adoption takes care of itself." },
    { "question": "How do we handle client data privacy with AI tools?", "answer": "This is an important question and one we take seriously. We only recommend tools with clear data handling policies, and we help you evaluate the privacy implications of any tool before adopting it. Many AI tools designed for accounting have built in compliance features specifically for this reason." }
