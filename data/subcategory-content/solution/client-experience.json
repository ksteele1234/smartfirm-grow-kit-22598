  "problemStatement": "Your {audience} clients are comparing you to every other service they use, not just other accounting firms. When they can track a pizza delivery in real time but cannot get a status update on their tax return, they start wondering if they chose the right firm.",
  "solutionOverview": "Client experience is not about being flashy. It is about being easy to work with, keeping people informed, and removing the friction that makes clients feel forgotten. The firms winning on experience are the ones that communicate proactively and make every interaction feel effortless.",

      "solution": "A client portal where people can upload documents, check status, sign forms, and pay invoices on their own schedule removes friction for clients and frees up your team simultaneously"

  "faqs": [
    { "question": "Our clients are not tech savvy. Will they actually use a portal?", "answer": "That is a fair concern and one we hear often. The portals we help implement are designed to be as simple as possible. That said, we always recommend keeping traditional options available alongside the portal so clients can transition at their own pace." },
    { "question": "We pride ourselves on personal service. Will automation make us seem impersonal?", "answer": "Great personal service and smart automation are not opposites. Automation handles the routine communications like status updates and reminders, which frees up your team to have more meaningful personal conversations about advisory topics and client needs." },
    { "question": "How do we get our team to actually use a new system?", "answer": "Adoption is something we plan for from the beginning. We design workflows that make your team's job easier, not harder, and we roll things out gradually. When people see that the system reduces their inbox load and client complaints, adoption tends to follow naturally." }
