  "problemStatement": "First impressions set the tone for every client relationship, and most {audience} are still onboarding new clients with scattered emails, missing documents, and unclear expectations. That inconsistency leads to scope creep, client frustration, and hours of unnecessary back and forth before any real work even begins.",
  "solutionOverview": "Firms that onboard well tend to retain clients longer and experience far fewer scope disputes. A structured onboarding system automates document collection, sets clear expectations upfront, and delivers a professional welcome experience that builds trust from day one.",
  "hearingSignals": [
    "New clients regularly show up unprepared because they did not receive clear instructions about what you need from them",
    "You spend the first few weeks of every engagement chasing documents and re explaining your process",

      "problem": "Every team member onboards clients differently, leading to inconsistent experiences and missed steps",
      "solution": "Standardized onboarding workflows with task templates ensure every client goes through the same proven process regardless of which team member handles the engagement"

  "faqs": [
    { "question": "What if we have different onboarding needs for different service lines?", "answer": "That is actually very common. We design onboarding workflows for each service type so a new tax client gets a different sequence than a new bookkeeping client. The automation handles the routing based on what the client signed up for." },
    { "question": "Will this feel impersonal to our clients?", "answer": "The opposite, actually. Automation handles the logistics like sending checklists and reminders so your team has more time for personal touchpoints. Clients experience a smooth, organized process while your team focuses on building the relationship." },
    { "question": "How do we handle clients who are slow to provide documents?", "answer": "Automated reminder sequences follow up at intervals you define, escalating gently until documents arrive. Your team only needs to step in for clients who need extra attention, rather than chasing every single one manually." }
