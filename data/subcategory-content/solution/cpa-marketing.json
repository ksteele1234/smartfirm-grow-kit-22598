Sustainable growth comes from building genuine authority in your market through reputation, helpful content, local visibility, and consistent follow up with people who already know you.",

  "faqs": [
    { "question": "Should CPA firms run paid ads?", "answer": "It depends on your market and goals. Paid ads can work for specific, high intent searches in some markets, but they are rarely the best starting point. Most firms get better returns from optimizing their Google Business Profile, building reviews, and nurturing their existing network. We assess your situation before recommending any paid channels." },
    { "question": "What kind of content should accounting firms create?", "answer": "The most effective content answers the questions your ideal clients are already asking. Think tax deadline reminders, explanations of common deductions, guides for business owners on bookkeeping basics. It does not need to be frequent or elaborate. Consistency and relevance matter more than volume." },
    { "question": "We get most of our clients from referrals. Do we still need marketing?", "answer": "Referrals are a great sign that your clients trust you. Marketing does not replace referrals. It amplifies them. When someone gets referred to you and searches your name, your online presence either reinforces or undermines that referral. A strong marketing foundation makes referrals more likely to convert and adds additional channels on top." }
