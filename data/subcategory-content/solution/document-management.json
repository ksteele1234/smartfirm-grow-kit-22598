  "problemStatement": "Every {audience} knows the pain of chasing clients for documents. Tax organizers go unanswered, source documents arrive in drips and drabs, and your team wastes hours following up manually. During busy season, this bottleneck can bring your entire workflow to a standstill.",
  "solutionOverview": "Firms that have solved the document collection problem share a common approach: they make it ridiculously easy for clients to upload what is needed and let automation handle the reminders. A secure portal with clear requests and persistent follow up removes the burden from your team while getting documents in faster.",
  "hearingSignals": [
    "Your team spends hours every week sending follow up emails asking clients for the same documents they already requested",
    "Client documents arrive via email, text, fax, and even physical mail, and there is no single place where everything lives",
    "Busy season becomes a bottleneck not because of the work itself but because you cannot get the information you need to start"

    {
      "problem": "Clients receive a document request but ignore it because the list is overwhelming and there is no easy way to respond",
      "solution": "Client facing portals like LedgerDocs or similar tools break requests into clear, manageable items with drag and drop uploads so clients can submit documents on their phone in minutes"
    },
    {
      "problem": "Your team manually tracks which clients have submitted documents and which ones need another reminder, eating up hours of admin time",
      "solution": "Automated tracking dashboards show exactly which documents are outstanding for each client, and scheduled reminder sequences follow up without anyone on your team lifting a finger"

  "faqs": [
    { "question": "Will our clients actually use a document portal?", "answer": "Most clients prefer a portal once they try it. The key is making it simple. If a client can take a photo of a document with their phone and upload it in two taps, adoption tends to be high. We also design onboarding communications that walk clients through the process so the first experience is smooth." },
    { "question": "What about clients who still insist on emailing documents?", "answer": "That is totally normal and we plan for it. Many systems allow you to set up a dedicated email address that automatically routes attachments into the right client folder. Over time, as clients see how easy the portal is, most gradually shift on their own." },
    { "question": "Is this secure enough for sensitive financial documents?", "answer": "Absolutely. The portals we work with use bank level encryption and meet the security standards you would expect for handling financial data. They are significantly more secure than emailing documents as attachments, which is what most clients do now." }
