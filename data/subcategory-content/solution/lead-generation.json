  "solutionOverview": "Sustainable lead generation for accounting firms is not about buying lists or running aggressive ad campaigns. It is about building multiple channels that attract the right prospects consistently: a strong Google Business Profile, helpful content, a structured referral system, and targeted outreach that positions your firm as the obvious choice in your market.",

    "Your pipeline is either feast or famine depending on whether referrals happen to come in",

  "faqs": [
    { "question": "We are a small firm. Can we really compete with larger firms for leads?", "answer": "You can, and in many cases you have an advantage. Local clients often prefer working with smaller firms because of the personal attention. The key is making sure those clients can find you when they search. A well optimized Google Business Profile and strong reviews can put a two person firm alongside much larger competitors in local search results." },
    { "question": "How is this different from just running ads?", "answer": "Paid ads can be one piece of the puzzle, but we focus on building sustainable lead generation channels first. That means organic visibility through Google Business Profile, helpful content, and referral systems. These channels continue to produce leads over time without ongoing ad spend. If paid ads make sense for your market, we can layer those on top of a strong organic foundation." },
    { "question": "We already get referrals. Why do we need other lead sources?", "answer": "Referrals are excellent and we would never suggest replacing them. The goal is to build additional channels that work alongside referrals so your growth does not stall when referrals naturally slow down. Think of it as adding a floor under your growth so you always have leads coming in, even during quiet referral periods." }
