  "problemStatement": "Most {audience} scale by adding people, not by improving processes. The result is a firm where everything depends on someone remembering to do the next thing, and important tasks fall through the cracks when the team gets busy.",
  "solutionOverview": "Operational automation means identifying the repetitive, manual tasks that consume your team's time and replacing them with systems that run consistently without supervision. The firms that scale smoothly are the ones that automate the work behind the work.",
  "hearingSignals": [
    "Your team spends more time coordinating tasks than actually doing client work",
    "Important deadlines get missed because no one realized a step was waiting on someone else",

      "problem": "Team members constantly interrupt each other to ask about task status or hand off work",

    },
    {
      "problem": "Client communication is inconsistent because each team member handles it differently",
      "solution": "Templated communication workflows tied to specific engagement milestones ensure every client gets the right message at the right time, regardless of which team member is assigned"

  "faqs": [
    { "question": "Will automation make our firm feel impersonal?", "answer": "The opposite, actually. When your team is not buried in manual administrative tasks, they have more time for the personal interactions that clients value. Automation handles the behind the scenes work so your people can focus on relationships." },
    { "question": "What if our processes are not documented yet?", "answer": "That is completely normal and actually a great starting point. Part of our discovery process involves documenting how your firm really operates. Many firms find that exercise valuable on its own, even before we start automating anything." },
    { "question": "Do we need to switch to new software?", "answer": "Not necessarily. We start by looking at what you already use and finding automation opportunities within your existing tools. If there are gaps, we will recommend options, but we never push a tool change that does not clearly justify itself." }
