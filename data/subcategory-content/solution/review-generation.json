We typically request a review from each client once or twice per year, but we stagger requests across your client base so new reviews come in every month. This keeps the flow steady without any individual client feeling over asked." },
        { "question": "My clients are small business owners who are always busy. Will they actually respond?", "answer": "Small business owners are busy, which is exactly why the one click direct link approach works. When the process takes 30 seconds and arrives right after they received value from your work, response rates are typically much higher than you would expect. Many bookkeepers are surprised at how willing their clients are once the process is easy." },
        { "question": "I only have 15 to 20 clients. Is that enough to increase online reviews meaningfully?", "answer": "Absolutely. If even half your clients leave a review over the next 6 to 12 months, that is 8 to 10 reviews, which is a strong foundation for a local bookkeeping practice. Combined with any new clients you onboard, your review count grows steadily. Start with what you have." }

      "heroSubtitleTemplate": "Getting reviews is one thing. Getting consistently 5 star reviews is another. It starts with understanding what drives a client to not just leave a review, but to leave a glowing one. Here is how accounting practices generate 5 star reviews that attract the right clients.",
      "problemStatement": "Most accounting practice owners want to generate 5 star reviews, not just accumulate a high count of generic ratings. A practice with 50 generic 3 and 4 star reviews is less compelling than one with 30 detailed 5 star reviews that speak to specific strengths. The challenge is creating conditions where clients are motivated to leave thoughtful, enthusiastic feedback rather than perfunctory ratings.",
      "solutionOverview": "The practices that generate 5 star reviews consistently focus on three things: delivering experiences worth raving about, asking at the moment when enthusiasm is highest, and making the review process so simple that the client's momentum carries them through. The practices getting the best reviews are not just automating the ask. They are engineering the entire client experience to create natural review worthy moments.",

      "faqs": [
        { "question": "Is it ethical to route dissatisfied clients away from public reviews?", "answer": "Yes, as long as you are not preventing anyone from leaving a public review. Sentiment routing simply offers dissatisfied clients a direct channel to share their concern with you privately. If they still want to leave a public review, they can. The goal is to give unhappy clients a better way to be heard, not to suppress feedback." },
        { "question": "Can the review request messaging really influence the quality of reviews?", "answer": "Absolutely. A request that says 'We would appreciate a review' gets very different responses than one that says 'If there is anything specific about working with us that stood out, we would love to hear about it.' Small phrasing changes can significantly influence how much detail and enthusiasm clients put into their review." },
        { "question": "We already have a few low star reviews. Will more 5 star reviews help?", "answer": "Yes. A practice with 5 reviews including one 3 star looks much more vulnerable than a practice with 50 reviews and a 4.9 average that includes one 3 star. When you generate 5 star reviews consistently, the volume naturally dilutes the occasional lower rating and strengthens your overall profile." }
