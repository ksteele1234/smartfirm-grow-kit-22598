  "problemStatement": "Let us be honest: social media for {audience} is harder than it is for most industries. Nobody is scrolling Instagram hoping to see a post about tax deadlines. But that does not mean social media is useless for your firm. It just means you need a realistic strategy.",
  "solutionOverview": "The accounting firms that get real value from social media have stopped trying to go viral and started focusing on the platforms and content types that actually matter for professional services. LinkedIn, educational content, and thought leadership tend to drive the most meaningful results. The goal is credibility and visibility, not likes.",
  "hearingSignals": [
    "You have firm social media accounts that have not been posted to in months because you do not know what to say",
    "You have tried posting but get almost no engagement and question whether it is worth the time",
    "You see competitors posting regularly and worry you are falling behind even though you are not sure it is working for them either"
  ],
  "problemSolutionPairs": [
    {
      "problem": "You do not know what to post because accounting topics feel too boring or technical for social media",
      "solution": "The content that works best for accounting firms is educational and practical. Quick tips, deadline reminders, common mistakes to avoid, and answers to questions your clients ask you every week. This type of content builds trust and keeps your firm visible without trying to be entertaining"
    },
    {
      "problem": "You are spreading yourself thin trying to be on every platform with no clear return on any of them",
      "solution": "For most {audience}, LinkedIn is the highest value platform because your ideal clients and referral partners are there. Focusing on one or two platforms well produces better results than being inconsistent on five"

  "faqs": [
    { "question": "Is social media really worth the effort for accounting firms?", "answer": "It depends on your goals. Social media is rarely the primary lead generator for accounting firms, and we are upfront about that. But it plays a valuable supporting role in building credibility, staying visible to referral sources, and reinforcing your other marketing efforts. The key is having realistic expectations and a sustainable approach." },
    { "question": "Which platforms should we focus on?", "answer": "For most {audience}, LinkedIn is the highest priority because your clients and referral partners are there. Facebook can be useful for local visibility depending on your market. We assess your specific situation during discovery, but we typically recommend focusing on one to two platforms well rather than being everywhere poorly." },
    { "question": "How often do we need to post?", "answer": "Consistency matters more than frequency. Two to three quality posts per week on LinkedIn is a solid starting point for most firms. We would rather see you post twice a week consistently than post daily for two weeks and then disappear for a month." }
