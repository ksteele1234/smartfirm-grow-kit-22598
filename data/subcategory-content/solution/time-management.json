  "problemStatement": "Most {audience} spend a significant portion of their week on tasks that do not require their expertise: formatting emails, chasing documents, updating spreadsheets, and managing scheduling. This administrative burden leaves less time for billable work and strategic growth.",
  "solutionOverview": "The firms reclaiming their time are not working harder or hiring more people. They are identifying the repetitive, low value tasks that consume their week and replacing them with automated systems that run in the background. The time savings compound as more processes are automated.",
  "hearingSignals": [
    "You regularly work evenings or weekends just to keep up with administrative tasks",
    "Marketing, client communication, and business development always get pushed to later",

  "faqs": [
    { "question": "Which tasks should we automate first?", "answer": "During discovery, we identify the tasks consuming the most time relative to their complexity. Common starting points include client communications, document requests, scheduling, and routine follow ups." },
    { "question": "Will automation make our firm feel impersonal?", "answer": "The opposite, actually. When routine tasks are handled automatically, your team has more time for personal, high value interactions with clients. Automation handles the administrative work so humans can focus on relationship building." },
    { "question": "How much time can we realistically save?", "answer": "It varies significantly by firm. We assess your specific situation during discovery and focus on the areas where automation will deliver the most meaningful time savings for your practice." }
