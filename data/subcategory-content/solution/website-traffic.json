  "problemStatement": "Most {audience} have a website that looks professional enough but generates almost no traffic and even fewer inquiries. You built it once, maybe updated it a couple of times, and now it sits there doing very little for your practice.",
  "solutionOverview": "The accounting firms that consistently attract website visitors have done a few specific things well: they show up in local search results, they publish content that answers the questions their ideal clients are already searching for, and they have optimized their Google Business Profile so it works as a second homepage. None of this requires a massive budget, but it does require a strategy.",

    "Your website gets fewer than a handful of organic visitors per week and you are not sure why",
    "You show up on page two or three of Google when someone searches for accounting services in your area",

      "problem": "Your website does not rank for any of the terms potential clients are searching for in your area",

    {
      "problem": "You have no content strategy and your website has not been updated since it was built",
      "solution": "Publishing helpful content that answers common client questions signals to Google that your site is active and relevant. Even two to three articles per quarter on topics like tax planning tips or bookkeeping best practices can make a meaningful difference over time"

  "faqs": [
    { "question": "How long does it take to see results from SEO?", "answer": "SEO is a longer term strategy. Some improvements like Google Business Profile optimization can show results in weeks. Content and on page SEO typically take three to six months to gain momentum. We focus on quick wins alongside the longer term strategy so you are not waiting months to see any progress." },
    { "question": "Do we need to blog every week to make this work?", "answer": "No. Quality matters more than quantity for accounting firms. Two to three well written, helpful articles per quarter can make a real difference. We help you identify the topics that will have the most impact so you are not creating content just for the sake of it." },
    { "question": "Should we be running Google Ads instead of doing SEO?", "answer": "They serve different purposes. Ads can generate immediate visibility, but they stop the moment you stop paying. SEO builds an asset that continues delivering traffic over time. Many firms find the best approach is a combination, but we assess your specific situation before recommending where to invest." }
