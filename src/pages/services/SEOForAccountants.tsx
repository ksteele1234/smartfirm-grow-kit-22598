        question: "How long does SEO take to show results?",
        answer: "Local SEO improvements (Google Maps rankings) typically show within 60-90 days. Organic search rankings for competitive keywords take 4-6 months. Most firms see their first SEO-generated leads within 90 days and consistent monthly leads by month 6."

        question: "What's the difference between SEO and Google Ads?",
        answer: "Google Ads generate immediate leads but stop when you stop paying. SEO builds long-term rankings that generate leads for years without ongoing ad spend. We recommend both: ads for immediate leads while SEO builds, then reduce ad spend as organic traffic grows."

      },
      {
        question: "Will this work if I'm in a competitive market?",
        answer: "Yes, but it takes longer. In competitive markets (major metros), we focus on hyper-local keywords (\"CPA in [neighborhood]\") and niche services (\"R&D tax credit specialist\") where you can rank faster. Most firms see results within 6 months even in competitive markets."
