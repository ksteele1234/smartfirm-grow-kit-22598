# Pre-rendering Solution for Structured Data

## Install vite-plugin-ssr or similar
```bash
npm install vite-plugin-prerender
```

## Configure in vite.config.ts
This will generate static HTML files with structured data at build time, solving the SEO issue completely.

Key routes to pre-render:
- /faq
- /solutions-expert-marketing-agency-for-accounting-firms
- /leading-marketing-services-for-accounting-firms
- /services/* (all service pages)
- /solutions/* (all solution pages)
- /industries/* (all industry pages)

This ensures search engines see structured data immediately without JavaScript execution.
