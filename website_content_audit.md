### Founder Story Section

**Section Heading (H2):** Meet the Founder & CEO

**Subheading:** Hey, I'm Katie!

**Content:**

**About SmartFirm:**
Hi, I'm Katie Steele, founder of SmartFirm.

I created SmartFirm because I saw firsthand how many accounting professionals were drowning in daily tasks, struggling to keep up with marketing, and missing out on business growth—not because they weren't good at what they do, but because they didn't have the right systems in place and most aren't career marketers.

Before SmartFirm, I spent over 20 years leading business transformations across industries and countries helping companies streamline operations, implement smarter systems, and scale with confidence. From turning around struggling hospitality brands to guiding private equity investments and implementing Microsoft Dynamics 365 at enterprise scale, I've built a career helping businesses unlock their full potential.

Now I bring all of that to the work I do with accounting firms.

**Why It Works Card:**
- **Title:** Why It Works
- **Content:** I don't just understand marketing — I understand business. I've helped companies:
  - Double revenue in less than a year
  - Reduce manual workload with smart automation
  - Turn referrals into consistent, trackable growth
  - Build scalable systems that don't rely on guesswork

**Why I Started SmartFirm Card:**
- **Title:** Why I Started SmartFirm
- **Content:** 
  - Most firm owners don't have the time, or desire, to become tech experts. I get it. You want more clients, more time, and more peace of mind. You don't need another software; you need a system that works for you. That's exactly what SmartFirm delivers.
  - We set everything up: lead capture tools, review automation, voice and chat AI, appointment funnels, SEO boosters, and nurture campaigns so you don't have to touch the tech. Everything is designed to run in the background while you stay focused on serving your clients.
  - SmartFirm is the system I wish every accounting firm had years ago. It's simple, effective, and built to help you grow without burnout.
  - If you're ready to finally have your marketing handled and actually start seeing results, I'd love to show you how.

**Q: Can you help specialized practices like tax preparation or bookkeeping?**
A: Yes, we have extensive experience with specialized practices including tax preparation, bookkeeping services, forensic accounting, wealth management, audit & assurance, and business advisory services. We tailor our approach to your specific niche and client base.
